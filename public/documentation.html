Movie API Program Documentation This Movie API will integrate with a database
storing movies (titles), their genre, director, image URLs, and more. By using
this API, the user can obtain detailed information about directors (bio, birth
year, death year), detailed information about specific genres, and the user can
interact with the API to make a user profile. This profile will allow them to
store a list of favorite movies they can add on to. The user will be able to
modify their profile in multiple ways and also de-register from the platform
entirely.
